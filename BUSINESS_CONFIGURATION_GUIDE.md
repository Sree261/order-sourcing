## üîß Scoring Configuration System

### Core Scoring Factors

The system evaluates locations based on these configurable factors:

| Factor | Description | Weight Range | Business Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Transit Time** | Days to deliver | -20.0 to 0.0 | Faster delivery = higher score |
| **Processing Time** | Hours to process order | -10.0 to 0.0 | Faster processing = higher score |
| **Inventory Availability** | Stock level ratio | 0.0 to 100.0 | More inventory = higher score |
| **Distance** | Geographic proximity | -1.0 to 0.0 | Closer locations = higher score |
| **Express Priority** | Same-day/next-day bonus | 0.0 to 50.0 | Express-capable locations get bonus |
| **Split Penalty** | Multi-location penalty | 0.0 to 50.0 | Penalty for splitting orders |

### Pre-configured Scoring Profiles

#### 1. **Default Scoring** (`DEFAULT_SCORING`)
Standard configuration for general order fulfillment:
```json
{
  "transitTimeWeight": -10.0,
  "processingTimeWeight": -5.0,
  "inventoryWeight": 50.0,
  "expressWeight": 20.0,
  "splitPenaltyBase": 15.0,
  "distanceWeight": -0.5
}
```

#### 2. **Electronics Premium** (`ELECTRONICS_PREMIUM_SCORING`)
Enhanced configuration for high-value electronics:
```json
{
  "transitTimeWeight": -15.0,
  "processingTimeWeight": -8.0,
  "inventoryWeight": 60.0,
  "expressWeight": 30.0,
  "splitPenaltyBase": 20.0,
  "distanceWeight": -0.8,
  "highValueThreshold": 1000.0,
  "highValuePenalty": 30.0
}
```

#### 3. **Express Delivery** (`EXPRESS_DELIVERY_SCORING`)
Optimized for same-day and next-day delivery:
```json
{
  "transitTimeWeight": -20.0,
  "processingTimeWeight": -10.0,
  "inventoryWeight": 40.0,
  "expressWeight": 50.0,
  "splitPenaltyBase": 30.0,
  "distanceWeight": -1.0,
  "sameDayPenalty": 40.0,
  "nextDayPenalty": 30.0
}
```

#### 4. **Hazmat Handling** (`HAZMAT_SCORING`)
Specialized configuration for hazardous materials:
```json
{
  "transitTimeWeight": -12.0,
  "processingTimeWeight": -7.0,
  "inventoryWeight": 45.0,
  "expressWeight": 25.0,
  "splitPenaltyBase": 25.0,
  "distanceWeight": -0.6,
  "hazmatAdjustment": -0.30
}
```

## üè≠ Business Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Peak Season Optimization

**Challenge**: During Black Friday/Cyber Monday, some locations become overloaded while others have capacity.

**Solution**: Create a peak season scoring configuration:
```sql
INSERT INTO scoring_configuration (
    id, name, description, is_active, category,
    transit_time_weight, processing_time_weight, inventory_weight, express_weight,
    split_penalty_base, distance_weight, peak_season_adjustment
) VALUES (
    'PEAK_SEASON_2024', 'Peak Season Black Friday 2024', 
    'Adjusted scoring for peak season capacity management', 
    true, 'SEASONAL',
    -8.0, -3.0, 70.0, 15.0,
    10.0, -0.3, -0.20
);
```

**Business Impact**:
- **Reduced inventory weight** (-8.0 vs -10.0) prioritizes speed over stock levels
- **Increased inventory weight** (70.0 vs 50.0) ensures availability during high demand
- **Lower split penalty** (10.0 vs 15.0) allows more flexible fulfillment
- **Peak season adjustment** (-0.20) accounts for seasonal delays

### Use Case 2: Electronics Security Handling

**Challenge**: Electronics items need secure handling and trusted locations.

**Solution**: Use Electronics Premium scoring for electronics categories:
```json
{
  "sku": "LAPTOP_PREMIUM_001",
  "quantity": 1,
  "scoringConfigurationId": "ELECTRONICS_PREMIUM_SCORING",
  "productCategory": "ELECTRONICS_COMPUTER",
  "specialHandling": "HIGH_VALUE"
}
```

**Business Impact**:
- **Higher security penalties** for untrusted locations
- **Stricter distance requirements** for high-value items
- **Enhanced processing time penalties** for locations with poor security records

### Use Case 3: Geographic Expansion

**Challenge**: New market entry requires testing different location strategies.

**Solution**: Create region-specific scoring:
```sql
INSERT INTO scoring_configuration (
    id, name, description, is_active, category,
    transit_time_weight, processing_time_weight, inventory_weight, 
    distance_weight, distance_threshold
) VALUES (
    'WEST_COAST_EXPANSION', 'West Coast Market Entry', 
    'Testing scoring for new West Coast locations', 
    true, 'GEOGRAPHIC',
    -12.0, -6.0, 45.0, 
    -0.8, 75.0
);
```

**Business Impact**:
- **Tighter distance thresholds** (75km vs 100km) for new market testing
- **Balanced approach** between speed and reliability
- **A/B testing capability** against default scoring

## üìä Location Filtering System

### Filter Categories

#### 1. **Delivery Type Filters**
- **Same Day Delivery** (`SDD_FILTER_RULE`): Locations capable of same-day delivery
- **Standard Delivery** (`STANDARD_DELIVERY_RULE`): General delivery locations
- **Express Delivery** (`EXPRESS_FILTER_RULE`): Next-day delivery capable locations

#### 2. **Product Category Filters**
- **Electronics Security** (`ELECTRONICS_SECURE_RULE`): Secure handling facilities
- **Frozen Food** (`FROZEN_FOOD_RULE`): Cold chain storage locations
- **Hazmat** (`HAZMAT_FILTER_RULE`): Hazardous material certified locations

#### 3. **Operational Filters**
- **Peak Season Capacity** (`PEAK_SEASON_RULE`): High-capacity locations during peak times
- **High Value Items** (`HIGH_VALUE_RULE`): Secure locations for expensive items

### Creating Custom Filters

```sql
INSERT INTO location_filter (
    id, name, description, filter_script, is_active, 
    category, execution_priority, cache_ttl_minutes
) VALUES (
    'CUSTOM_SAME_DAY_PRIORITY', 
    'Custom Same Day Priority Filter', 
    'Priority locations for same-day delivery in metro areas',
    'location.transitTime <= 1 && calculateDistance(location.latitude, location.longitude, order.latitude, order.longitude) <= 25',
    true, 'DELIVERY_TYPE', 1, 30
);
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Fulfillment Success Rate**: Percentage of orders successfully fulfilled
2. **Average Score**: Overall scoring performance across orders
3. **Split Shipment Rate**: Percentage of orders requiring multiple locations
4. **Delivery Time Performance**: Actual vs. promised delivery times
5. **Location Utilization**: Distribution of orders across locations

### Scoring Analysis Query

```sql
SELECT 
    sc.name as scoring_config,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    AVG(fp.overall_score) as avg_score,
    AVG(fp.total_fulfilled::float / fp.requested_quantity) as fulfillment_rate,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fp.is_multi_location_fulfillment THEN 1 END) as split_orders
FROM fulfillment_plans fp
JOIN scoring_configuration sc ON fp.scoring_config_id = sc.id
WHERE fp.created_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY sc.name
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

## üîÑ Configuration Management

### Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always version your scoring configurations
2. **A/B Testing**: Test new configurations on a subset of orders
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement changes gradually to monitor impact
4. **Rollback Strategy**: Keep previous configurations active for quick rollback
5. **Documentation**: Document business rationale for each configuration

### Configuration Deployment Process

```sql
-- Step 1: Create new configuration (inactive)
INSERT INTO scoring_configuration (
    id, name, description, is_active, version, category,
    transit_time_weight, processing_time_weight, inventory_weight
) VALUES (
    'NEW_CONFIG_V2', 'New Configuration Version 2', 
    'Updated scoring for Q2 2024 optimization', 
    false, '2.0', 'SEASONAL',
    -12.0, -6.0, 55.0
);

-- Step 2: Test with specific order types
-- (Use API calls with specific scoringConfigurationId)

-- Step 3: Activate new configuration
UPDATE scoring_configuration 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE id = 'NEW_CONFIG_V2';

-- Step 4: Deactivate old configuration
UPDATE scoring_configuration 
SET is_active = false 
WHERE id = 'OLD_CONFIG_V1';
```

## üìã Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Low Fulfillment Rates
**Symptoms**: Many orders showing partial fulfillment
**Diagnosis**: Check inventory weights and thresholds
**Solution**: Increase inventory weight or adjust minimum thresholds

#### Issue 2: High Split Shipment Rate
**Symptoms**: Too many orders split across multiple locations
**Solution**: Increase split penalty or adjust inventory preferences

#### Issue 3: Poor Delivery Performance
**Symptoms**: Actual delivery times exceed promises
**Solution**: Adjust transit time and processing time weights

#### Issue 4: Unbalanced Location Utilization
**Symptoms**: Some locations overloaded, others underutilized
**Solution**: Adjust distance weights and location capacity factors

### Diagnostic Queries

```sql
-- Check scoring configuration usage
SELECT 
    sc.id,
    sc.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.temp_order_id) as order_count,
    AVG(fp.overall_score) as avg_score
FROM scoring_configuration sc
LEFT JOIN fulfillment_plans fp ON fp.scoring_config_id = sc.id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.id = fp.order_id
WHERE sc.is_active = true
GROUP BY sc.id, sc.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- Analyze fulfillment patterns
SELECT 
    location_id,
    COUNT(*) as fulfillment_count,
    AVG(location_score) as avg_location_score,
    AVG(allocated_quantity) as avg_quantity
FROM location_allocations
WHERE created_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY location_id
ORDER BY fulfillment_count DESC;
```

This configuration system provides the flexibility to adapt your order sourcing strategy to changing business needs while maintaining optimal performance and customer satisfaction.

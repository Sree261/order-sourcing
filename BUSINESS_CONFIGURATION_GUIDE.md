# Business Configuration Guide: Dynamic Order Sourcing with Configurable Scoring

## Overview

The Order Sourcing Engine provides a powerful **Configurable Scoring System** that allows businesses to dynamically adjust how locations are selected for order fulfillment. Instead of relying on hard-coded business rules, the system enables real-time configuration of scoring weights to optimize for different business scenarios, product types, and market conditions.

## üéØ Key Business Benefits

### 1. **Dynamic Business Rule Management**
- **No Code Deployments Required**: Change scoring logic instantly through database configuration
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Respond to market changes, seasonal demands, or operational constraints immediately
- **A/B Testing Capability**: Test different scoring strategies simultaneously to optimize performance

### 2. **Product-Specific Optimization**
- **Category-Based Scoring**: Different rules for electronics, groceries, hazmat, high-value items
- **Custom Weightings**: Tailor location selection criteria for specific product characteristics
- **Compliance Integration**: Built-in support for regulatory requirements (hazmat, cold chain, etc.)

### 3. **Operational Flexibility**
- **Peak Season Adjustments**: Automatically adjust for capacity constraints during high-demand periods
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance between speed, cost, and reliability based on business priorities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track how different configurations impact KPIs like delivery time and cost

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Key Features

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Configurable Scoring Engine**
- **20+ Configurable Parameters**: Transit time, inventory levels, processing capacity, distance, value thresholds
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines location capabilities, inventory availability, and business constraints
- **Script-Based Logic**: Advanced users can write custom scoring algorithms using AviatorScript

#### **2. Location Filtering System**
- **Rule-Based Filtering**: Pre-filter locations based on delivery type, product requirements, compliance needs

5. **Decision Output**: Returns optimal fulfillment plan with detailed scoring rationale

## üìä Business Configuration Examples

### **Example 1: E-commerce Electronics Retailer**

**Business Challenge**: High-value electronics require secure handling and fast delivery, but cost optimization is crucial for competitive pricing.

**Configuration Strategy**: `ELECTRONICS_PREMIUM_SCORING`

#### **Key Factors & Weightings**:
- **Transit Time Weight**: -15.0 (vs -10.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Electronics customers expect fast delivery; heavily penalize distant locations
- **Inventory Weight**: +60.0 (vs +50.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Prefer locations with high stock levels to avoid stockouts on popular items
- **High Value Threshold**: $1000 (vs $500 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Apply extra security measures for premium electronics
- **Split Penalty Base**: 20.0 (vs 15.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Customers prefer single shipment for electronics purchases

#### **Business Impact**:
```
Scenario: Customer orders iPhone 15 Pro ($1299) from NYC

DEFAULT_SCORING Results:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Brooklyn Warehouse (2 days): Score 20.0 ‚≠ê Selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manhattan Store (1 day): Score 35.0 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Newark DC (3 days): Score 10.0

ELECTRONICS_PREMIUM_SCORING Results:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Brooklyn Warehouse (2 days): Score 14.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manhattan Store (1 day): Score 37.0 ‚≠ê Selected  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Newark DC (3 days): Score -1.0
```

**Outcome**: Customer receives iPhone next day instead of 2 days, improving satisfaction and reducing return risk.

### **Example 2: Grocery Chain with Fresh & Frozen Products**

**Business Challenge**: Fresh and frozen items require specialized cold-chain handling with strict delivery timeframes, while managing operational costs.

**Configuration Strategy**: `COLD_CHAIN_OPTIMIZED_SCORING`

#### **Key Factors & Weightings**:
- **Distance Weight**: -1.0 (vs -0.5 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Cold chain integrity degrades with distance; minimize transport time
- **Processing Time Weight**: -10.0 (vs -5.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Longer processing increases spoilage risk for perishables
- **Same Day Penalty**: 5.0 (vs 25.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Encourage same-day delivery for fresh items to reduce waste
- **Custom Scoring Script**: 
  ```javascript
  base = location.transitTime * scoring.transitTimeWeight + 
         inventory.ratio * scoring.inventoryWeight;
  
  // Boost for cold-chain certified locations
  if (location.hasColdChain && order.requiresColdStorage) {
      base += 25.0;
  }
  
  // Penalty for non-certified locations handling cold items
  if (!location.hasColdChain && order.requiresColdStorage) {
      base -= 50.0;
  }
  
  return base;
  ```

#### **Business Impact**:
```
Scenario: Customer orders frozen pizza + fresh produce from suburban Chicago

STANDARD_SCORING Results:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Suburban Store (no cold chain): Score 15.0 ‚≠ê Selected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cold Storage DC (1 day): Score 10.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Regional Hub (2 days): Score 5.0

COLD_CHAIN_OPTIMIZED_SCORING Results:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Suburban Store (no cold chain): Score -35.0 (disqualified)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cold Storage DC (1 day): Score 35.0 ‚≠ê Selected
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Regional Hub (2 days): Score -45.0 (disqualified)
```

**Outcome**: Order ships from certified cold storage facility, ensuring product quality and compliance with food safety regulations.

### **Example 3: B2B Industrial Supplier**

**Business Challenge**: Industrial customers prioritize reliability and cost over speed, with tolerance for multi-location shipments if it reduces costs.

**Configuration Strategy**: `B2B_COST_OPTIMIZED_SCORING`

#### **Key Factors & Weightings**:
- **Transit Time Weight**: -5.0 (vs -10.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: B2B customers more flexible on delivery time in exchange for lower costs
- **Split Penalty Base**: 5.0 (vs 15.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: B2B customers accept multiple shipments to optimize inventory costs
- **Inventory Weight**: +75.0 (vs +50.0 default)
  - *Business Logic*: Strongly prefer locations with high stock to fulfill large quantity orders
- **Distance Threshold**: 200km (vs 100km default)
  - *Business Logic*: Willing to ship from farther locations for better pricing

#### **Business Impact**:
```
Scenario: Manufacturing company orders 100 units of industrial equipment

STANDARD_SCORING Results:
Single Location Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Warehouse (50 units): Score 25.0, PARTIAL fulfillment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Split Penalty: N/A

Multi-Location Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Warehouse (50 units): Score 25.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Regional DC (50 units): Score 15.0  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Split Penalty: -15.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Total Score: 25.0 ‚≠ê Selected (partial fulfillment)

B2B_COST_OPTIMIZED_SCORING Results:
Single Location Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Warehouse (50 units): Score 37.5, PARTIAL fulfillment

Multi-Location Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Warehouse (50 units): Score 37.5
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Regional DC (50 units): Score 27.5
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Split Penalty: -5.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Total Score: 60.0 ‚≠ê Selected (full fulfillment)
```

**Outcome**: Customer receives complete order via two shipments at lower total cost, meeting B2B preference for complete fulfillment over speed.
